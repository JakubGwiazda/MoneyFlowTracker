### Backend and Database

- Use supabase for backend service, including authentication and database interactions
- Follow Supabase guidlines for security and performance
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with backend
- Use supabase from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly
- Use supabaseClient type from 'src/db/supabase.client.ts' not from '@supabase/supabase-js'
